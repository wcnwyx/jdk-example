/**
 * Hash table based implementation of the <tt>Map</tt> interface.  This
 * implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
 * <tt>null</tt> values and the <tt>null</tt> key.  (The <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * class is roughly equivalent to <tt>Hashtable</tt>, except that it is
 * unsynchronized and permits nulls.)  This class makes no guarantees as to
 * the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order
 * will remain constant over time.
 * 基于哈希表的Map接口实现。此实现提供所有可选映射操作，并允许null值和null键。
 * （HashMap类大致相当于Hashtable，只是它不同步并且允许空值。）
 * 此类不保证map的顺序；特别是，它不能保证顺序在一段时间内保持不变。
 *
 * <p>This implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic
 * operations (<tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>), assuming the hash function
 * disperses the elements properly among the buckets.  Iteration over
 * collection views requires time proportional to the "capacity" of the
 * <tt>HashMap</tt> instance (the number of buckets) plus its size (the number
 * of key-value mappings).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
 * capacity too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is
 * important.
 * 此实现为基本操作(get和put)提供了恒定的时间性能，前提是哈希函数将元素正确地分散在存储桶中。
 * 对集合视图的迭代需要与HashMap实例的"容量"（bucket数）加上其大小（键值映射数）成比例的时间。
 * 因此，如果迭代性能很重要，那么不要将初始容量设置得太高（或负载系数太低），这一点非常重要。
 *
 * <p>An instance of <tt>HashMap</tt> has two parameters that affect its
 * performance: <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  The
 * <i>capacity</i> is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial
 * capacity is simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created.  The
 * <i>load factor</i> is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to
 * get before its capacity is automatically increased.  When the number of
 * entries in the hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the
 * current capacity, the hash table is <i>rehashed</i> (that is, internal data
 * structures are rebuilt) so that the hash table has approximately twice the
 * number of buckets.
 * HashMap的实例有两个影响其性能的参数： 初始容量 和 加载因子。
 * 容量 是哈希表中的存储桶数，初始容量只是创建哈希表时的容量。
 * 加载因子是在自动增加哈希表容量之前允许哈希表达到的满度的度量。
 * 当哈希表中的条目数超过加载因子和当前容量的乘积时，哈希表将被重新设置（即，重建内部数据结构），
 * 以便哈希表的存储桶数大约是当前存储桶数的两倍。
 *
 * <p>As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good
 * tradeoff between time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the
 * space overhead but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of
 * the operations of the <tt>HashMap</tt> class, including
 * <tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>).  The expected number of entries in
 * the map and its load factor should be taken into account when
 * setting its initial capacity, so as to minimize the number of
 * rehash operations.  If the initial capacity is greater than the
 * maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no rehash
 * operations will ever occur.
 * 作为一般规则，默认负载系数（.75）在时间和空间成本之间提供了良好的权衡。
 * 较高的值会减少空间开销，但会增加查找成本（反映在HashMap类的大多数操作中，包括get和put）。
 * 在设置初始容量时，应考虑map中的预期条目数及其负载系数，以尽量减少重新设置次数。
 * 如果初始容量大于最大入口数除以加载因子，则不会发生再灰化操作。
 *
 * <p>If many mappings are to be stored in a <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * instance, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow
 * the mappings to be stored more efficiently than letting it perform
 * automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.  Note that using
 * many keys with the same {@code hashCode()} is a sure way to slow
 * down performance of any hash table. To ameliorate impact, when keys
 * are {@link Comparable}, this class may use comparison order among
 * keys to help break ties.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of
 * the threads modifies the map structurally, it <i>must</i> be
 * synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
 * that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value
 * associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a
 * structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 * synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.
 *
 * If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access to the map:<pre>
 *   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));</pre>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by all of this class's "collection view methods"
 * are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
 * the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 * <tt>remove</tt> method, the iterator will throw a
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 * arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
 * future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
