/**
 * This class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any
 * non-<code>null</code> object can be used as a key or as a value. <p>
 * 此类实现了一个哈希表，它将key映射到values。任何非空的对象都可以用来作为key或value。
 *
 * To successfully store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the
 * objects used as keys must implement the <code>hashCode</code>
 * method and the <code>equals</code> method. <p>
 * 要成功地从哈希表存储和检索对象，用作键的对象必须实现hashCode方法和equals方法。
 *
 * An instance of <code>Hashtable</code> has two parameters that affect its
 * performance: <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  The
 * <i>capacity</i> is the number of <i>buckets</i> in the hash table, and the
 * <i>initial capacity</i> is simply the capacity at the time the hash table
 * is created.  Note that the hash table is <i>open</i>: in the case of a "hash
 * collision", a single bucket stores multiple entries, which must be searched
 * sequentially.  The <i>load factor</i> is a measure of how full the hash
 * table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased.
 * The initial capacity and load factor parameters are merely hints to
 * the implementation.  The exact details as to when and whether the rehash
 * method is invoked are implementation-dependent.<p>
 *
 * Generally, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff between
 * time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the space overhead but
 * increase the time cost to look up an entry (which is reflected in most
 * <tt>Hashtable</tt> operations, including <tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>).<p>
 *
 * The initial capacity controls a tradeoff between wasted space and the
 * need for <code>rehash</code> operations, which are time-consuming.
 * No <code>rehash</code> operations will <i>ever</i> occur if the initial
 * capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries the
 * <tt>Hashtable</tt> will contain divided by its load factor.  However,
 * setting the initial capacity too high can waste space.<p>
 *
 * If many entries are to be made into a <code>Hashtable</code>,
 * creating it with a sufficiently large capacity may allow the
 * entries to be inserted more efficiently than letting it perform
 * automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table. <p>
 *
 * This example creates a hashtable of numbers. It uses the names of
 * the numbers as keys:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   Hashtable<String, Integer> numbers
 *     = new Hashtable<String, Integer>();
 *   numbers.put("one", 1);
 *   numbers.put("two", 2);
 *   numbers.put("three", 3);}</pre>
 *
 * <p>To retrieve a number, use the following code:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   Integer n = numbers.get("two");
 *   if (n != null) {
 *     System.out.println("two = " + n);
 *   }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by the <tt>iterator</tt> method of the collections
 * returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are
 * <em>fail-fast</em>: if the Hashtable is structurally modified at any time
 * after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 * <tt>remove</tt> method, the iterator will throw a {@link
 * ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 * arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
 * The Enumerations returned by Hashtable's keys and elements methods are
 * <em>not</em> fail-fast.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
 *
 * <p>As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to
 * implement the {@link Map} interface, making it a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 *
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.  Unlike the new collection
 * implementations, {@code Hashtable} is synchronized.  If a
 * thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use
 * {@link HashMap} in place of {@code Hashtable}.  If a thread-safe
 * highly-concurrent implementation is desired, then it is recommended
 * to use {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap} in place of
 * {@code Hashtable}.
