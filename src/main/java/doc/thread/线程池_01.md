##接口：Executor
```java
/**
 * An object that executes submitted {@link Runnable} tasks. This
 * interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the
 * mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread
 * use, scheduling, etc.  An {@code Executor} is normally used
 * instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than
 * invoking {@code new Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start()} for each
 * of a set of tasks, you might use:
 * 
 * 一个执行提交Runnable任务的对象。这个接口提供了一种将任务提交与如何运行每个任务的机制分离的方法，包括线程使用、调度等细节。
 * 通常使用Executor，而不是显式地创建线程。例如：不会为了一组任务中的每一个任务调用new Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start()，
 * 你可以使用下面的方法：
 *
 * <pre>
 * Executor executor = <em>anExecutor</em>;
 * executor.execute(new RunnableTask1());
 * executor.execute(new RunnableTask2());
 * ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * However, the {@code Executor} interface does not strictly
 * require that execution be asynchronous. In the simplest case, an
 * executor can run the submitted task immediately in the caller's
 * thread:
 * 
 * 但是，Executor接口并不严格要求执行是异步的。最简单的情况下，执行器可以在调用者的线程中立即运行提交的任务。
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class DirectExecutor implements Executor {
 *   public void execute(Runnable r) {
 *     r.run();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * More typically, tasks are executed in some thread other
 * than the caller's thread.  The executor below spawns a new thread
 * for each task.
 * 更典型的是，任务在调用者以外的线程中执行。下面的执行器为每一个提交的任务生成一个新的线程。
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class ThreadPerTaskExecutor implements Executor {
 *   public void execute(Runnable r) {
 *     new Thread(r).start();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * Many {@code Executor} implementations impose some sort of
 * limitation on how and when tasks are scheduled.  The executor below
 * serializes the submission of tasks to a second executor,
 * illustrating a composite executor.
 * 许多Executor的实现对任务的调度方式和时间加了某种限制。
 * 下面的executor将提交的任务序列化到第二个executor，解释了一个组合的executor。
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class SerialExecutor implements Executor {
 *   final Queue<Runnable> tasks = new ArrayDeque<Runnable>();
 *   final Executor executor;
 *   Runnable active;
 *
 *   SerialExecutor(Executor executor) {
 *     this.executor = executor;
 *   }
 *
 *   public synchronized void execute(final Runnable r) {
 *     tasks.offer(new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() {
 *         try {
 *           r.run();
 *         } finally {
 *           scheduleNext();
 *         }
 *       }
 *     });
 *     if (active == null) {
 *       scheduleNext();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   protected synchronized void scheduleNext() {
 *     if ((active = tasks.poll()) != null) {
 *       executor.execute(active);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The {@code Executor} implementations provided in this package
 * implement {@link ExecutorService}, which is a more extensive
 * interface.  The {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} class provides an
 * extensible thread pool implementation. The {@link Executors} class
 * provides convenient factory methods for these Executors.
 * 这个包中提供的Executor的实现，其实现了ExecutorService，这是一个更广泛的接口。
 * ThreadPoolExecutor类提供了一个可扩展的线程池实现。Executors类为这些执行器提供了方便的工厂方法。
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to
 * submitting a {@code Runnable} object to an {@code Executor}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * its execution begins, perhaps in another thread.
 * 内存一致性影响：在将可运行对象提交给执行器之前，线程中的操作发生在其执行开始之前，可能发生在另一个线程中。

public interface Executor {

    /**
     * Executes the given command at some time in the future.  The command
     * may execute in a new thread, in a pooled thread, or in the calling
     * thread, at the discretion of the {@code Executor} implementation.
     * 在将来的某个时间执行给定的命令。命令可以在一个新线程、一个线程池或者调用者的线程中执行，
     * 具体由Executor的实现来决定
     * @param command the runnable task 可运行的任务
     * @throws RejectedExecutionException if this task cannot be
     * accepted for execution 如果无法接受此任务执行
     * @throws NullPointerException if command is null

    void execute(Runnable command);
}
```
总结：Executor接口就是将任务的提交和执行细节给封装起来了，上层不需要知道了解。
常见的执行方式有以下几种：
1. 直接在调用者的线程中执行。（没啥意义，还不如调用者线程直接调用呢）
2. 每一个任务都在一个新的线程中执行。
3. 任务在线程池中执行。ThreadPoolExecutor就是这种实现



##接口ExecutorService
```java
/**
 * An {@link Executor} that provides methods to manage termination and
 * methods that can produce a {@link Future} for tracking progress of
 * one or more asynchronous tasks.
 * 一个Executor，它提供了管理终止的方法和生成Future的方法，Future用于追踪一个或多个异步任务。
 *
 * <p>An {@code ExecutorService} can be shut down, which will cause
 * it to reject new tasks.  Two different methods are provided for
 * shutting down an {@code ExecutorService}. The {@link #shutdown}
 * method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before
 * terminating, while the {@link #shutdownNow} method prevents waiting
 * tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks.
 * Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no
 * tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted.  An
 * unused {@code ExecutorService} should be shut down to allow
 * reclamation of its resources.
 * ExecutorService可以关闭，这将导致拒绝新任务。提供两种方法来关闭ExecutorService。
 * shutdown方法允许在终止之前执行先前提交的任务。
 * shutdownNow方法阻止等待的任务启动并且尝试停止正在执行中的任务。
 * 终止后，executor没有正在执行的任务，没有等待执行的任务，并且不能提交新的任务。
 * 一个没用的ExecutorService应该关闭，以回收其资源。
 *
 * <p>Method {@code submit} extends base method {@link
 * Executor#execute(Runnable)} by creating and returning a {@link Future}
 * that can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion.
 * Methods {@code invokeAny} and {@code invokeAll} perform the most
 * commonly useful forms of bulk execution, executing a collection of
 * tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to
 * complete. (Class {@link ExecutorCompletionService} can be used to
 * write customized variants of these methods.)
 * submit方法通过创建并返回一个Future来扩展基础方法Executor.execute(Runnable)，
 * Future可以用来取消执行 和/或 等待完成。
 * invokeAny和invokeAll用来做最常用的批量执行，执行一组任务并且等待至少一个或全部任务完成。
 * （ExecutorCompletionService类可以用来编写这些方法的自定义变体）
 *
 * <p>The {@link Executors} class provides factory methods for the
 * executor services provided in this package.
 * Executors类为这个包中提供的executor services提供工厂方法。
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 * 示例用法
 *
 * Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread
 * pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured {@link
 * Executors#newFixedThreadPool} factory method:
 * 下面是一个网络服务的简述，其中线程池中的线程为传入的请求提供服务。
 * 它使用预定义的Executors.newFixedThreadPool工厂方法：
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class NetworkService implements Runnable {
 *   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
 *   private final ExecutorService pool;
 *
 *   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)
 *       throws IOException {
 *     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
 *     pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
 *   }
 *
 *   public void run() { // run the service
 *     try {
 *       for (;;) {
 *         pool.execute(new Handler(serverSocket.accept()));
 *       }
 *     } catch (IOException ex) {
 *       pool.shutdown();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * class Handler implements Runnable {
 *   private final Socket socket;
 *   Handler(Socket socket) { this.socket = socket; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     // read and service request on socket
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The following method shuts down an {@code ExecutorService} in two phases,
 * first by calling {@code shutdown} to reject incoming tasks, and then
 * calling {@code shutdownNow}, if necessary, to cancel any lingering tasks:
 * 下面的方法分两步来关闭ExecutorService，首先调用shutdown来拒绝接受新任务，
 * 然后调用shutdownNow，如果必须的话，取消任何继续存留的任务。
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService pool) {
 *   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted
 *   try {
 *     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate
 *     if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
 *       pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks
 *       // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled
 *       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
 *           System.err.println("Pool did not terminate");
 *     }
 *   } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *     // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted
 *     pool.shutdownNow();
 *     // Preserve interrupt status
 *     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to the
 * submission of a {@code Runnable} or {@code Callable} task to an
 * {@code ExecutorService}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * any actions taken by that task, which in turn <i>happen-before</i> the
 * result is retrieved via {@code Future.get()}.
